But I didn\\'t like driving under Ritalin - I was used to having my attention all over the place and being able to see EVERYTHING that was going on around me:  traffic slowing 5 blocks up; a wingnut weaving thru lanes 2 blocks behind.

I don\\'t sleep much, which is why I usually don\\'t take it on weekends to catch up on sleep. It kills my appetite, so I eat a big breakfast before I take it in the mornings.

So I started Metadate CD and I was not irritable on that one at all :) But it seemed to wear off within 4 hours and made me soo tired.
