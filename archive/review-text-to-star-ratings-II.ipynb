Other aspects of the process--e.g., scraping, cleaning, or visualizing the data--are not included here.

But the worst thing was not being able to control my bowel movements.  The thing is I did not realize it was the abilify causing these problems.  The way I figured out the cause was I ran out of abilify and was off it for about a week.  I started regaining control of my bowels (this is one thing they don't list as a side affect).  That had to be the most embarrassing period of my life.  Since I quit taking the drug I lost 80 pounds and my hand stopped shaking.  But best of all I have control of my bowels.

Within two weeks I was feeling better than I have in many years. The feelings of sadness are gone and I wake up feeling ready to face the day. It has helped me tremendously. For me, this drug has worked miracles I never thought possible. \n",
